Our mission is to connect consumers with healthy, sustainable, fresh foods. We will achieve this by aggregating producers and providers of sustainable food by geographic market.

We will:

Focus initial growth on Chattanooga and Baltimore partnering with the aquariums for educational and promotional support and local fisheries, purveyors, and farmers to identify restaurants serving their sustainably produced foods. 

Focus initial scope on sustainable seafood as a model to then expand to all type of argra/aquaculture. 

Partner with local farms, fisheries, dairies, and suppliers to provide resources for restaurants who would like to provide sustainable dining options fostering a collaborative community.

Partner with individuals in specific cities to crowdsource restaurant and supplier recommendations and reviews. This community will fuel growth to other cities. 

Partner with organizations such as Riverkeepers to align with social causes and build communities gaining further knowledge of regional suppliers and restaurants. 

Secure corporate sponsors such as Patagonia to promote our efforts and connect with communities around the globe aligning with corporate social goals.

Long term growth through social media community development, blogging and video series. 

Partner with the State Department and other organisations to promote sustainable food production. 

Long term growth proving consumer resources for sourcing sustainably sourced ingredients from local markets and suppliers, expanding on recipes provided by aquariums and organizations advocating sustainable seafood.
